                    I am a person who is passionate about learning new technologies and applying them in every project that I have participated in. One of my motivations is to create things from scratch to achieving a product or services that is successful for the people. My experience and my knowledge was gained throughout 8 years. Firstly, I was working 3 years as system administrator, then I started working in as healthcare consultant during 1 year, after that I had the opportunity to progress to a healthcare project manager where I have been involved almost three years. Lately I have giving my time between web project manager and web software developer.
